					<p class="p1">On the basis of your consent pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 (1) Letter a of the GDPR, our websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). Google Analytics is used for expedient design and improvement of our website.</p>
					<p class="p1">Google Analytics uses cookies and creates pseudonymous user profiles. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our website (browser type and version; operating system, referrer URL, IP address and time of the server request) is usually transmitted to and stored by Google on a server in the United States. Before doing so, Google abbreviates your IP address within the Member States of the European Union or in other signatory states to the EEA Treaty and renders it anonymous in such a way that it cannot be allocated to your person (IP masking). The IP address is not put together with other data by Google. Pursuant to Art. 28 of the GDPR, Google uses the information on our behalf to evaluate your use of our websites, to produce reports about the website activities and to provide other services related to the use of our websites and the internet.</p>
					<p class="p1">If you have not given your consent to the use of tracking cookies, then such tracking cookies will not be put on your device. You can also prevent registration of the data generated by the cookie regarding your use of our websites (including your IP address) and the processing of such data by Google by downloading and installing the browser add-on available under the following link: <a href="##" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>
					<p class="p1">As an alternative to the browser add-on, you can use <a href="javascript:gaOptout()">this link</a> to prevent registration by Google Analytics. In this case, an opt-out cookie is placed on your device that prevents your data from being registered in future when you visit our websites. Please note that this opt-out cookie only applies to this browser and to our websites. You will have to set the cookie again if you delete the cookies in your browser.</p>
					<p class="p1">Please note that our websites also use Google Analytics for cross-device analysis of visitor flows based on a user ID. To prevent registration by Universal Analytics across different devices, you would have to implement the opt-out on all used systems.</p>
					<p class="p1">Please refer to the following Google websites for more information about terms and privacy in relation to Google Analytics: <a href="##" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics terms</a>, <a href="##" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data security and privacy principles of Google Analytics</a> and in the <a href="##" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google privacy policy</a>.</p>
